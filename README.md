## What is it?

**PostureFix** is a Python-based application designed to help users maintain good posture while working at their desks. It uses a webcam to monitor posture, alerting users when they slouch or adopt bad posture habits. The program is customizable, allowing users to adjust sensitivity thresholds, alert methods, and more, making it a versatile tool for ergonomic improvement.
